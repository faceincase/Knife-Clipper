> [!WARNING]  
> Code will be added soon.

## How does it work?
1. Put mp4 clips in folder `BEFORE`.
2. Run the python code. You can see the progress in console/output.
3. Ready clips will be saved in `AFTER` folder.


> [!TIP]
> It's recommended to use short clips. All clips would work however longer clip = longer time to process.
